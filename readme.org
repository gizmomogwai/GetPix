* GetPix for Android
With a recent release of Android, my old photo solution (pulling the
images via mtp) did not work for me anymore.

So I decided that I wanted another way of getting my images from my
phone to my computer.

GetPix is a simple server implemented for android, that exposes your
images in a REST-protocol.

** Protocol
*** GET /index
gets a json of all available images

*** GET /files/{}
gets one of the indexed images as binary

*** POST /files filename={} suffix={}
marks on of the indexed images as transferred, suffix is the marker (I
use my username).

** Used libraries
- The great nanohttp-library
- junit
- assertj-core
- and the android sdk

** Open Issues
- make GetPix a proper service
- make the apk smaller
